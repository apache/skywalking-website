Observability essential when working with distributed systems. Built on 3 pillars of metrics, logging and 
tracing, having the right tools in place to quickly identify and determine the root cause of an issue in production
is imperative. In this Kongcast interview, we explore the benefits of having observability and demo the use of
Apache SkyWalking. We walk through the capabilities that SkyWalking offers out of the box and debug a common HTTP 500 
error using the tool.
