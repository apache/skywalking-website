Yanlong He (GitHub: [heyanlong](https://github.com/heyanlong)) is a SkyWalking committer for years. 
He was working on [skyapm-php](https://github.com/SkyAPM/SkyAPM-php-sdk) for years to support the SkyWalking
ecosystem. That PHP agent has significant contributions for SkyWalking's users adoption in the PHP landscape. 
Yanlong keeps active in supporting and maintaining the project to help the community.

Jiemin Xia (GitHub: [jmjoy](https://github.com/jmjoy)) is a new committer voted in July 2022. He is super active in this year.
He took over the maintaince capatbilify from Rei Shimizu, who is too busy in his daily work.
He leads on the [Rust SDK](https://github.com/apache/skywalking-rust), and is also a release manager for the Rust SDK.

Recently, both of them are working with Yanlong He to build a new skywalking PHP agent.

We are having our PHP agent v0.1.0 for the community.

Notice, **SkyAPM PHP** is going to be **archived and replaced** by SkyWalking PHP agent according to its project maintainer, Yanlong He.
Our community would work more closely forward the new PHP agent together.

Let's welcome and congrats to our 31st and 32nd PMC members, Yanlong He and Jiemin Xia. We are honored to have you.
