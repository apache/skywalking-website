* Fix `funcParamExpression` and `literalExpression` can't be used in the same aggregation function.
* Support cast statement in the OAL core engine.
* Support `(str->long)` and `(long)` for string to long cast statement.

* Support `-Inf` as bucket in the meter system.
* Fix setting wrong field when combining `Event`s.
