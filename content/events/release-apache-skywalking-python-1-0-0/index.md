SkyWalking Python 1.0.0 is released! Go to [downloads](/downloads) page to find release tars.

**PyPI Wheel**: https://pypi.org/project/apache-skywalking/1.0.0/

**DockerHub Image**: https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/skywalking-python

- **Important Notes and Breaking Changes:**

  - The new PVM metrics reported from Python agent requires SkyWalking OAP v9.3.0 to show out-of-the-box.
  - **BREAKING**: Python 3.6 is no longer supported and may not function properly, Python 3.11 support is added and tested.
  - **BREAKING**: A number of common configuration options and environment variables are renamed to follow the convention of Java agent,
    please check with the latest official documentation before upgrading. (#273, #282)
    https://skywalking.apache.org/docs/skywalking-python/v1.0.0/en/setup/configuration/
  - **BREAKING**: All agent core capabilities are now covered by test cases and enabled by default (Trace, Log, PVM runtime metrics, Profiler)
  - **BREAKING**: DockerHub Python agent images since v1.0.0 will no longer include the `run` part in `ENTRYPOINT ["sw-python", "run"]`,
    user should prefix their command with `[-d/--debug] run [-p/--prefork] <Command>` for extra flexibility.
  - Packaged wheel now provides a extra [all] option to support all three report protocols
