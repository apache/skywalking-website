#### Project

* Fix `Duplicate class found` due to the `delombok` goal.

#### OAP Server

* Fix wrong layer of metric `user error` in DynamoDB monitoring.
* ElasticSearch storage does not check field types when OAP running in `no-init` mode.
* Support to bind TLS status as a part of component for service topology.
* Fix component ID priority bug.
* Fix component ID of topology overlap due to storage layer bugs.
* [Breaking Change] Enhance JDBC storage through merging tables and managing day-based table rolling.
* [Breaking Change] Sharding-MySQL implementations and tests get removed due to we have the day-based rolling mechanism by default

* Fix `NPE` when query the not exist series indexes in ElasticSearch storage. 
* Support collecting memory buff/cache metrics in VM monitoring.
* PromQL: Remove empty values from the query result, fix `/api/v1/metadata` param `limit` could cause out of bound.

* Support `exportErrorStatusTraceOnly` for export the error status trace segments through the Kafka channel
* Add component ID for Grizzly.
* Fix potential NPE in Zipkin receiver when the `Span` is missing some fields.
* Filter out unknown_cluster metric data.
* Support RabbitMQ Monitoring.
* Support Redis slow logs collection.

* Envoy ALS generated relation metrics considers http status codes >= 400 has an error at the client side.
* Add cause message field when query continuous profiling task.

#### UI
* Revert: cpm5d function. This feature is cancelled from backend.
* Fix: alerting link breaks on the topology.
* Refactor Topology widget to make it more hierarchical.
  1. Choose `User` as the first node.
  2. If `User` node is absent, choose the busiest node(which has the most calls of all).
  3. Do a left-to-right flow process.
  4. At the same level, list nodes from top to bottom in alphabetical order.
* Fix filter ID when ReadRecords metric associates with trace.

* [Clean UI templates before upgrade] Set `showSymbol: true`, and make the data point shows on the Line graph.
  Please clean `ui_template` index in elasticsearch storage or table in JDBC storage.
* [Clean UI templates before upgrade] UI templates: Simplify metric name with the label.
* Add MQ menu.
* Add Jeysey icon.
* Fix: set endpoint and instance selectors with url parameters correctly.
* Bump up dependencies versions icons-vue 1.1.4, element-plus 2.1.0, nanoid 3.3.6, postcss 8.4.23
* Add OpenTelemetry log protocol support.
* [Breaking Change] Configuration key `enabledOtelRules` is renamed to `enabledOtelMetricsRules` and
  the corresponding environment variable is renamed to `SW_OTEL_RECEIVER_ENABLED_OTEL_METRICS_RULES`.

#### Documentation

* Add Profiling related documentations.
* Add `SUM_PER_MIN` to MAL documentation.
* Make the log relative docs more clear, and easier for further more formats support.
