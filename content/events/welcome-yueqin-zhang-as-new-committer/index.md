I am excited to announce a new SkyWalking committer, Yueqin Zhang(GitHub ID, yswdqz).
Yueqin entered the SkyWalking community on Jul. 3rd[1], 2022, for the first time. 
Later, I knew he was invited by Yihao Chen, our committer, who is running an open-source program for students who can't join Summer 2022 due to SkyWalking having limited slots.

His first PR[2] for Issue #7420 took 20 days to propose. I believe he took incredibly hard work in his own time. 
For every PMC member, we all were there. Purely following documents and existing codes to build a new feature is always not easy to start. 

After that, we had several private talks, he asked for more possible directions to join the community deeper.
Then, I am honored to witness a great landscape extension in SkyWalking feature territory, SkyWalking adopts OpenTelemetry features quickly, and is powered by our powerful MAL and v9 kernel/UI, 
He built MySQL and PostgreSQL server monitoring, metrics, and slow SQLs collecting(through enhancing LAL with a new layer concept), under a new menu, <Database>.

It is unbelievable to see his contributions in the main repo, 8 PRs[3],  LOC 4,857++, 1,627--

Meanwhile, this story continues, he is trying to build **A lightweight and APM-oriented SQL parser module**[4] under my mentoring. This would be another challenging idea, but also very useful to 
enhance existing virtual database perf. analyzing.

I believe this would not be the end for the moment between SkyWalking and him.

Welcome to join the team.

Referrer & PMC member, Sheng Wu.
