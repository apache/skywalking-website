I am exciting to annouce a new SkyWalking committer, Yueqin Zhang(GitHub ID, yswdqz).
Yueqin entered the SkyWalking community on Jul. 3rd[1], 2022, in the first time. 
Later, I knew he was invited by Yihao Chen, our committer, who is running an open-source program for students who can't join Summer 2022 due to SkyWalking having limited slots.

His first PR[2] for Issue #7420 took 20 days to propose. I believe he took an incredible hard work in his own time. 
For every PMC member, we all were there. Purely following documents and existing codes to build a new feature is always not easy to start. 

After that, we had several private talks, he asked for more possible directions to join the community deeper.
Then, I am honored to witness a great landscape extension in SkyWalking feature territory, SkyWalking adopts OpenTelemetry features quickly, and powered by our powerfule MAL and v9 kernel/UI, 
He built MySQL and PostgreSQL server monitoring, metrics and slow SQLs collecting(through enhancing LAL with new layer concept), under a total new menu, <Database>.

It is unbelievable to see his contributions in the main repo, 8 PRs[3],  LOC 4,857++, 1,627--

Meanwhile, this story continous, he is trying to build <A lightweight and APM-oriented SQL parser module>[4] under my mentoring. This would be another challenge idea, but also very useful to 
enhance existing virtual database perf. analyzing.

I belive this would not be the end for the moment between SkyWalking and him.

Welcome to join the team.
